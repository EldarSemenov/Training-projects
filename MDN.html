<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
    Molly had been staring out of her window for about<br/>
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<br/>
    <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals <br/>
    her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <br/>
    <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book<br/>
    since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls<br/>
    walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
</p>
<p>
    She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under<br/>
    a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that<br/>
    <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q><br/>
    Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the <br/>
    secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,<br/>
    to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <em>did</em> think she had<br/>
    somothing better to do.
