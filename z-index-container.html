            <h1>Z-index. Description</h1>
            <p>My task was to make the child-2 on the top
                of all blocks. If we just add z-index to this child,
                it's not gonna work since its parent on the 
                bottom of the stacking context. To achive the result 
                I just added z-index to his parent on hover pseudo class to 
                make its child-2 on the top of all elements.
                And also I gave z-index: 2; to the child-2 to be higher than 
                its parent. Place your cursour on the navigation purple block.

            <p>P.S. The light-blue hidden circle that you see has the position absolute,
                his parent footer container has overflow: hidden. If you work with the 
                <code>< body ></body></code><code>overflow:hidden;</code>,
                add the same to the < html >. Also its working if you use overflow: auto;
